    <h2>Hello! I'm Shane</h2>
    <h3>Making it Happen</h3>
    <p>Before design, I worked in a real estate association for 5 years and before THAT, I worked selling toys and gadgets.</p>
    <p>I made the decision to get into programming in early 2020 but the world had other plans. Life during a pandemic helped me gain a lot of perspective and I realized that I needed to make a BIG change for myself and my happiness. While I loved my coworkers, I knew it was time to be moving along. I left that job and began persuing a degree in web design and started taking courses in UX/UI design.</p>

    <h3>Why Design?</h3>
    <p>I have always had a passion for making things. From Lego, to clothing, to music and movies, creating is one of my major joys in life. I also consider myself a very empathetic person who just wants everyone to be able to enjoy life as much as possible and as easily as possible. Imagine my excitement when I found out that a path in web and UX design would allow me to turn both of those passions into a career!</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>Besides designing for websites, you can also find me working on 3D design and 3D printing, as well as designing and sewing pieces of clothing/accessories. I also love spending time at the beach, watching movies (I'm a big time horror guy), playing music, and playing Magic: the Gathering with friends.</p>
